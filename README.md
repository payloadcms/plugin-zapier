# Payload Zapier Plugin

This plugin can be added to a Payload project to make it simple to send Zaps to a zapier webhook address when collection data changes. It is designed to be flexible and generic to allow for any use-cases to manage zaps.

#### Requirements

- A Payload project
- A Zapier account with webhooks configured. [More](https://zapier.com/help/create/code-webhooks/trigger-zaps-from-webhooks)

## Usage

Install this plugin within your Payload as follows:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config';
import path from 'path';
import Users from './collections/Users';
import { zapierPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-zapier';

export default buildConfig({
  plugins: [
    zapierPlugin({
      zapierCollectionSlug: 'zaps', // optional, defaults to 'zaps'
      access: { // optional, defaults to { read: () => true }
        read: () => true,
        create: () => true,
        update: () => true,
        delete: () => true,
      },
      collections: ['posts'], // optional, defaults to all collections
      enabled: async ({ req }) => false, // optional, defaults to true
    })
  ],
  // The rest of your config goes here
```

## Features

**Send Zaps**
The plugin adds a Zaps collection that allows you to connect `afterChange` and `afterDelete` events from specific collections to a zapier webhook endpoint within the Payload admin panel.
